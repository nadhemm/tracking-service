# ParcelLab Data transformer Service
This service is used to:
- receive and validate api calls/files from client
- transform data
- send it to parcellab in correct format

**Transformer**

Transformers are used to transform the data received by the client to ParcelLab data model format

To add a new transformer you need to create a class that inherits `BaseTransformer`, add an input data schema and implement 
`_transform()` method that should transform input data into ParcelLab DataModel.

In this POC project, we assumed we have 2 consumer companies **MoezGmbH** and **NadhemGmbH**, each one uses a different data input format.
- MoezGmbH uses the API to send webhook on every new tracking request
- NadhemGmbH uses a file based tracking creation using csv files
